          <p class="lead">Bees are vital to the earth's balance. Bees travel from one flower to another, depositing pollen they have gathered on their bodies, thus cross-pollinating other plants which would have nary a hope to reproduce. Without bees, we wouldn't have 70% of the many various species of plants, flowers, and food we depend on for survival. Arader founder, Chris Arader, has been beekeeping for 40 years in the Main Line area in PA. Our expertise in this area has expanded our deep knowledge of plant's environmental needs.<br /><br />
